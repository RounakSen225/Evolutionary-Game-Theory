# Evolutionary-Game-Theory
Using Game Theory we can find out what strategies can be played by players
in a game by finding out the Nash Equilibria. This type of equilibria basically
indicates the set of strategies the players are most likely to make given the
cost and/or benefit of each strategy. 
While many games are static in nature, other types of games played
iteratively can be analyzed using a dynamical equation.
